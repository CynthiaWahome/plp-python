File Handling Assignment

Tasks

1. **File Creation**:
- Create a Python script named `file_handling_assignment.py` that performs the following:
    - Create a new text file named `my_file.txt` in write mode (`'w'`).
    - Write at least three lines of text to the file, including a mix of strings and numbers.

2. **File Reading and Display**:
- Enhance your script to:
    - Read the contents of `my_file.txt`.
    - Display the contents on the console.

3. **File Appending**:
- Modify the script to:
    - Open `my_file.txt` in append mode (`'a'`).
    - Append three additional lines of text to the existing content.

4. **Error Handling**:
- Implement error handling in your script using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to manage potential file-related exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`).
