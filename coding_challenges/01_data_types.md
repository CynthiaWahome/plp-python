## Data Types

1. **Create a List and Compute Sum**

   Write a program that accepts user input to create a list of integers. Then, compute the sum of all the integers in the list.

2. **Create and Print a Tuple**

   Create a tuple containing the names of five of your favorite books. Then, use a for loop to print each book name on a separate line.

3. **Dictionary for Personal Information**

   Write a program that uses a dictionary to store information about a person, such as their name, age, and favorite color. Ask the user for input and store the information in the dictionary. Then, print the dictionary to the console.

4. **Find Common Elements in Sets**

   Write a program that accepts user input to create two sets of integers. Then, create a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.

5. **List Comprehension with Odd-Length Words**

   Create a program that stores a list of words. Then, use list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the words that have an odd number of characters.

These tasks should test your understanding of basic concepts related to lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets in Python. Good luck!
