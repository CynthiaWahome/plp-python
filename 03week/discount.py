Create a function named `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that calculates the final price 
after applying a discount. The function should:

- Take the original price (`price`) and the discount percentage (`discount_percent`) as parameters.
- If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount.
- If the discount is less than 20%, return the original price.

Using the `calculate_discount` function:

- Prompt the user to enter the original price of an item.
- Prompt the user to enter the discount percentage.
- Print the final price after applying the discount.
- If no discount was applied, print the original price.
