Create a Python class named `Person`.  
The `Person` class should have the following attributes:  
- `name`: representing the person's name.  
- `age`: representing the person's age.  
- `gender`: representing the person's gender.  

Implement a method called `introduce` that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.  

Create an instance of the `Person` class and call the `introduce` method to display the person's information.  

Create a GitHub repository for your assignment and submit the link.
